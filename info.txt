Okay, this is an excellent and well-structured folder organization for a Clean Architecture-inspired application, especially for a multi-domain system like yours (IMS, HRM, Warehouse). It clearly separates concerns into `domains`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `interfaces`, and `core`.

Let's break down the strengths and provide some guidance for each section, particularly focusing on the IMS aspect since that's your current focus.

### Overall Structure Strengths:

1.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** This is the most significant strength. Each top-level directory (`core`, `domains`, `infrastructure`, `application`, `interfaces`, `tests`) has a distinct responsibility.
2.  **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Alignment:** The `domains` directory is a clear indicator of a DDD approach, with subdirectories for each major business area (IMS, HRM, Warehouse).
3.  **Clean Architecture Principles:** The layering (Entities, Repositories, Services/Use Cases, Infrastructure, Interfaces) aligns very well with Clean Architecture, allowing for testability, maintainability, and flexibility.
4.  **Scalability:** This structure will scale well as your application grows, making it easier to add new features or even new domains without creating a tangled mess.
5.  **Team Collaboration:** With clear boundaries, different teams or developers can work on different domains or layers simultaneously with fewer conflicts.

### Detailed Breakdown and Guidance (IMS Focus):

#### `app/core/`

This is your foundational layer.

  * **`config/`**: Good for environment-specific settings. You'll likely load these based on an environment variable (e.g., `APP_ENV`).
      * **Guidance:** Ensure you have a clear mechanism in `main.py` or a dedicated `settings.py` (often placed directly under `app/` or `app/core/`) to load the correct configuration based on the environment. Consider using `Pydantic Settings` for type-safe configuration.
  * **`exceptions/`**: Central place for custom application-wide exceptions.
      * **Guidance:** Define base exceptions here, and then more specific exceptions can live within their respective `domains` or `application` layers if they are domain-specific.
  * **`logging/`**: Essential for observability.
      * **Guidance:** Configure robust logging that can be easily adapted for different environments (console, file, external logging services).
  * **`middleware/`**: For cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, request ID generation, etc.
      * **Guidance:** Keep these generic and reusable across different API endpoints.
  * **`utils/`**: General helper functions.
      * **Guidance:** Be careful not to make this a dumping ground. If a utility function becomes domain-specific, move it closer to that domain.

#### `app/domains/`

This is the heart of your business logic, completely independent of infrastructure details.

  * **`ims/medicine/`**: Excellent breakdown for a sub-feature.
      * **`entities/medicine.py`**:
          * **Content:** This should contain your pure Python domain models (e.g., `MedicineEntity`, `CategoryEntity`, `DoseFormEntity`, `StrengthEntity`, `ATCCodeEntity`). These entities should only contain business logic and data, with no direct knowledge of persistence (database) or presentation (API).
          * **Guidance:** These are often simple classes or dataclasses. They define the structure and behavior of your core business objects. For example, a `MedicineEntity` might have methods like `increase_stock()` or `calculate_expiration_status()`.
      * **`repositories/medicine_repository.py`**:
          * **Content:** This defines the *interface* (Abstract Base Class - ABC) for interacting with medicine data. It specifies *what* operations can be performed (e.g., `get_by_id`, `add`, `update`, `delete`), but not *how* they are performed.
          * **Guidance:** Use Python's `abc` module to define `IMedicineRepository`. This interface will be implemented in the `infrastructure/repositories/ims/medicine_sqlalchemy_repository.py`.
      * **`services/medicine_service.py`**:
          * **Content:** These are domain services that encapsulate business rules and orchestrate operations involving one or more entities. They depend on the `IMedicineRepository` interface.
          * **Guidance:** A `MedicineService` might contain logic like "when a medicine is added, validate its strength and category," or "update medicine stock after a new purchase." It should *not* directly interact with the database or FastAPI request/response objects. It takes and returns domain entities.

#### `app/infrastructure/`

This layer provides the concrete implementations for interfaces defined in the `domains` layer.

  * **`database/models/ims/medicine.py`**:
      * **Content:** Your SQLAlchemy ORM models (e.g., `Medicine`, `Category`, `DoseForm`, `Strength`, `ATCCode`). These are tied to your database schema.
      * **Guidance:** These models will typically map directly to your database tables. They might have relationships defined (e.g., `Medicine` has a foreign key to `Category`). They should be distinct from your `Domain Entities` in `app/domains/ims/medicine/entities/medicine.py`. You'll need mapping logic (or mappers) to convert between your ORM models and your domain entities.
  * **`database/session.py`**:
      * **Content:** Functions like `get_db` (for dependency injection in FastAPI) and `create_all_tables`.
      * **Guidance:** Ensure `get_db` provides a session that is properly closed after each request.
  * **`repositories/ims/medicine_sqlalchemy_repository.py`**:
      * **Content:** This is where you *implement* the `IMedicineRepository` interface defined in `app/domains/ims/medicine/repositories/medicine_repository.py`. It uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the `infrastructure/database/models/ims/medicine.py` ORM models.
      * **Guidance:** This class will take a database session in its constructor (e.g., `__init__(self, db_session: Session)`). Its methods will perform CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy, converting ORM models to domain entities when returning data and converting domain entities to ORM models when saving.

#### `app/application/`

This layer contains application-specific logic, orchestrating interactions between domains and preparing data for presentation.

  * **`use_cases/ims/medicine_use_cases.py`**:
      * **Content:** These are specific application-level operations. They orchestrate interactions between domain services and potentially other application services. They define *what* an application can do.
      * **Guidance:** A `MedicineUseCases` class might have methods like `create_medicine(medicine_data: MedicineCreateSchema)`, `get_medicine_by_id(medicine_id: UUID)`, `update_medicine_stock(medicine_id: UUID, quantity: int)`. They receive input via schemas and return output also often via schemas (or directly domain entities if the schema is a direct representation). They depend on `MedicineService` and `IMedicineRepository` (injected).
  * **`schemas/ims/medicine_schemas.py`**:
      * **Content:** Pydantic models for request and response data (e.g., `MedicineCreate`, `MedicineUpdate`, `MedicineResponse`, `CategoryResponse`).
      * **Guidance:** These schemas define the data contract for your API. They should validate incoming data and shape outgoing data. They are distinct from domain entities and ORM models. You'll map between these schemas and your domain entities within the `use_cases` or `interfaces` layer.

#### `app/interfaces/api/v1/routers/ims/medicine_router.py`

This is your entry point for external interactions (the API).

  * **Content:** FastAPI router (`APIRouter`) defining your API endpoints for medicine.
  * **Guidance:**
      * Each endpoint (e.g., `/medicines`, `/medicines/{id}`) will use dependency injection to get instances of your `MedicineUseCases`.
      * The router's responsibility is to parse incoming requests (using `medicine_schemas`), call the appropriate `MedicineUseCases` method, handle potential exceptions (often through FastAPI's exception handlers), and return responses (again, using `medicine_schemas`).
      * **Dependency Injection:** You'll use FastAPI's `Depends` for `get_db` and to inject the repository and service/use case instances.

#### `main.py`

  * **Content:** Initializes your FastAPI application, includes routers, and sets up global middleware.
  * **Guidance:** This file should be relatively thin, acting as the composition root. It wires up the different layers by creating instances of repositories, services, and use cases, and injecting them where needed.

### Key Considerations and How to Implement

1.  **Mapping between Layers:** This is crucial. You'll need functions or classes to map:

      * **Pydantic Schemas \<-\> Domain Entities:** This happens in your `application/use_cases` or sometimes `interfaces/api` layer.
      * **Domain Entities \<-\> ORM Models:** This happens in your `infrastructure/repositories` layer.

    Example of a simple mapper in `infrastructure/repositories/ims/medicine_sqlalchemy_repository.py`:

    ```python
    from app.domains.ims.medicine.entities.medicine import MedicineEntity, CategoryEntity
    from app.infrastructure.database.models.ims.medicine import Medicine, Category

    class MedicineMapper:
        @staticmethod
        def to_entity(orm_medicine: Medicine) -> MedicineEntity:
            return MedicineEntity(
                id=orm_medicine.id,
                name=orm_medicine.name,
                description=orm_medicine.description,
                # ... map other fields
                category=CategoryMapper.to_entity(orm_medicine.category) if orm_medicine.category else None
            )

        @staticmethod
        def to_orm_model(entity_medicine: MedicineEntity) -> Medicine:
            return Medicine(
                id=entity_medicine.id, # Often set by DB for new entities
                name=entity_medicine.name,
                description=entity_medicine.description,
                # ... map other fields
                # category_id=entity_medicine.category.id if entity_medicine.category else None
            )

    class CategoryMapper:
        @staticmethod
        def to_entity(orm_category: Category) -> CategoryEntity:
            return CategoryEntity(
                id=orm_category.id,
                name=orm_category.name
            )

        @staticmethod
        def to_orm_model(entity_category: CategoryEntity) -> Category:
            return Category(
                id=entity_category.id,
                name=entity_category.name
            )
    ```

    You would use these mappers within `medicine_sqlalchemy_repository.py` to convert `Medicine` (ORM model) to `MedicineEntity` and vice-versa.

2.  **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI's `Depends` is your friend.

      * In `interfaces/api/v1/routers/ims/medicine_router.py`:
        ```python
        from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
        from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
        from app.application.schemas.ims.medicine_schemas import MedicineCreate, MedicineResponse
        from app.application.use_cases.ims.medicine_use_cases import MedicineUseCases
        from app.infrastructure.database.session import get_db
        from app.infrastructure.repositories.ims.medicine_sqlalchemy_repository import MedicineSQLAlchemyRepository
        from app.domains.ims.medicine.services.medicine_service import MedicineService # If you have domain services

        router = APIRouter()

        def get_medicine_repository(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
            return MedicineSQLAlchemyRepository(db)

        def get_medicine_service(
            medicine_repo: MedicineSQLAlchemyRepository = Depends(get_medicine_repository)
        ):
            # If MedicineService depends on IMedicineRepository
            return MedicineService(medicine_repo) # You might not need a separate domain service if use cases are thin

        def get_medicine_use_cases(
            medicine_service: MedicineService = Depends(get_medicine_service) # Or directly medicine_repo
        ):
            # If MedicineUseCases depends on MedicineService
            return MedicineUseCases(medicine_service) # Or MedicineUseCases(medicine_repo) if service is skipped

        @router.post("/medicines/", response_model=MedicineResponse)
        async def create_medicine(
            medicine_create: MedicineCreate,
            use_cases: MedicineUseCases = Depends(get_medicine_use_cases)
        ):
            try:
                medicine = use_cases.create_medicine(medicine_create)
                return MedicineResponse.from_entity(medicine) # Assuming a .from_entity() method on your schema
            except Exception as e:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
        ```
      * This shows a chain of dependencies. You might flatten this slightly depending on the complexity of your domain services vs. use cases. Often, a `UseCase` directly depends on a `Repository Interface`.

3.  **Error Handling:**

      * Define custom exceptions in `app/core/exceptions/` (e.g., `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`).
      * Raise these exceptions from your `domain` or `application` layers.
      * Catch and handle them in your `interfaces/api` layer (e.g., using FastAPI's `RequestValidationException` or custom exception handlers in `app/interfaces/api/errors/`).

4.  **Testing:** Your structure is perfect for testing.

      * **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/domains/ims/medicine/`):** Test `MedicineEntity` methods, `IMedicineRepository` interface contracts, and `MedicineService` business logic in isolation, mocking repositories.
      * **Application Tests (`tests/unit/application/ims/medicine/`):** Test `MedicineUseCases` logic, mocking the `MedicineService` or `IMedicineRepository`.
      * **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`):** Test `MedicineSQLAlchemyRepository` against a real (or in-memory) database. Test `MedicineUseCases` with concrete (but mocked or isolated) infrastructure components.
      * **E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/`):** Test the entire API flow, hitting the FastAPI endpoints.

### Summary and Next Steps:

Your folder structure provides a strong foundation. The key to making it work effectively is consistent implementation of the Clean Architecture principles:

  * **Dependencies flow inwards:** High-level policies (domains, application) should not depend on low-level details (infrastructure). Low-level details *implement* interfaces defined by high-level policies.
  * **Interfaces separate concerns:** Define interfaces (ABCs) at the boundary between layers (e.g., `IMedicineRepository` in `domains` implemented in `infrastructure`).
  * **Data transfer objects/schemas:** Use distinct data structures for different layers (domain entities, ORM models, Pydantic schemas).

You're off to a fantastic start with this robust structure. Good luck with your IMS development\!
